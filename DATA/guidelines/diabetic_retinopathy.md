# Clinical Guidelines: Diabetic Retinopathy

## Definition
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).

## Stages
1. **Mild Nonproliferative Retinopathy**: Microaneurysms occur.
2. **Moderate Nonproliferative Retinopathy**: Blood vessels swell and distort.
3. **Severe Nonproliferative Retinopathy**: Many blood vessels are blocked.
4. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)**: Advanced stage. New, fragile blood vessels grow (Neovascularization).

## AI Prediction Verification
When verifying an AI prediction of "Diabetic Retinopathy":
1. **Exudates**: Look for yellow/white deposits (lipid leakage).
2. **Hemorrhages**: Dot-and-blot hemorrhages or flame hemorrhages.
3. **Cotton Wool Spots**: Fluffy white patches indicating ischemia.
4. **Neovascularization**: Fine, lace-like vessels near the disc (PDR).

## Management
- **Strict Blood Sugar Control**: The most effective way to slow progression.
- **Anti-VEGF Injections**: For Diabetic Macular Edema (DME).
- **Laser Photocoagulation**: To seal leaking vessels.
