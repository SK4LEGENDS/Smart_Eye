# Clinical Guidelines: Glaucoma Management

## Definition
Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, the health of which is vital for good vision. This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in your eye.

## Diagnosis Criteria
- **Intraocular Pressure (IOP)**: Levels above 21 mmHg are considered elevated, though glaucoma can occur at normal pressures (Normal Tension Glaucoma).
- **Optic Nerve Head Assessment**: Increased cup-to-disc ratio (>0.5) or asymmetry between eyes suggests glaucomatous damage.
- **Visual Field Test**: Peripheral vision loss is a hallmark sign.

## AI Prediction Verification
When verifying an AI prediction of "Glaucoma":
1. Check the **Cup-to-Disc Ratio** in the fundus image. A larger pale center indicates nerve fiber loss.
2. Look for **ISNT Rule violation**: Normally, the neuroretinal rim is thickest Inferiorly, then Superiorly, Nasally, and Temporally. Deviation suggests pathology.
3. Check for **Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) defects**: Wedge-shaped darkening spreading from the disc.

## Management
- **Prostaglandin Analogs**: First-line treatment to increase outflow (e.g., Latanoprost).
- **Beta-blockers**: Reduce aqueous production (e.g., Timolol).
- **Observation**: For "Glaucoma Suspects" with healthy fields but suspicious discs, monitor every 6 months.

## Patient Communication
- "Can I reverse the vision loss?" -> No, damage is permanent. Treatment prevents further loss.
- "Is it hereditary?" -> Yes, family history is a major risk factor.
